# CSE2221_Notes
This repository contains my handwritten notes for CSE 2221 (Software 1) at The Ohio State University. The notes cover foundational concepts of software design and programming using Java, as part of the course curriculum. These notes are intended for personal use and to help others understand key topics from the course.
